Benner)<br>We describe an algorithm to compute the explicit inverse of a dense quasi-definite matrix, i.e., a symmetric matrix of the form [-BB^T, A; A^T, C^TC], with the (1,1) block negative semidefinite and the (2,2) block positive semidefinite. The algorithm is a variant of Gauss-Jordan elimination that works on the low-rank factors $B$ and $C$ directly without ever forming those blocks. The individual elimination steps amount to a transformation called *principal pivot transform*; it was shown in [Poloni, Strabic 2016] how to perform it by working only on $A, B, C$, and we rely on that procedure here. We discuss the stability of the resulting method, and show how the algorithm (and in particular the produced low-rank factors) can be of use in control theory, in the context of the matrix sign iteration, which is a method used to solve algebraic Riccati equations.| September 30, 2020|
